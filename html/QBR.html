    <h1 id="QBR-header">6 Metrics to Review in Your QBR</h1>
    <p>
        We’re approaching the end of the year and of the fourth quarter. Start preparing for your quarterly business review now, and look out for a few things. Expectations and reality don’t always align, and it’s impossible to meet 100% of quotas 100% of the time. Understanding six key metrics will help you and your team improve strengths and weaknesses, as well as optimize your sales strategies for the future.
        <h2>1. Employee Efficiency</h2>
        To determine employee efficiency, track each salesperson’s actual orders and compare them to their personal expectation based on tenure and quota and the official quota adjusted for seasonality. In the technology field, we expect new hires to achieve 10 to 20% of their sales quotas in their first few months. On average, we find it takes 15 to 18 months for them to reach 95% efficiency. Ramp rates of new hires change based on sales position and type of company, so these percentages may change.
        The difference in the green and blue lines in the figure below represents the ramp rates. This particular employee exceeded her ramp expectations in the first two months of her employment and is projected to continue to do so in November. The expected orders from December onward show that this employee will have to increase the orders in their pipeline for the future.
