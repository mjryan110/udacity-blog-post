    <p>
        <h2>How Do We Define Effective?</h2>
        As marketers, we need to have the answers to many questions. A big question that we often answer is, how effective are my marketing campaigns?
        To get a clear picture of how effective a marketing campaign is, we need to consider these three questions:
        <ol>
            <li>What is the definition of effective?</li>
            <li>What do effective campaigns look like?</li>
            <li>What are the attributes of a campaign that make it effective?</li>
        </ol>        
        A quick Google search defined <b>effective</b> to mean: <blockquote> producing a desired or intended result</blockquote> The desired result of a marketing campaign is more closed won opportunities. So, an effective marketing campaign must play a role in winning new opportunities.

        Now that we have defined what effective means in terms of marketing campaigns, we want to look at what do effective campaigns look like and what makes them effective.
        We answer these questions with sales and marketing data that we aggregated and anonymized from many business-to-business software companies using Optimized Sales & Marketing.
        <h2>What does an effective campaign look like?</h2>
        As we defined above, an effective campaign plays a role in winning new opportunities. Let’s call a campaign that wins at least one opportunity a successful campaign and those that do not, unsuccessful.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that we have a classification of successful vs unsuccessful campaigns, let’s see what that means for our pipeline.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do successful campaigns drive more pipeline?
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes!
        <br>
        <br>
        You can see below that a successful campaign creates 8X the opportunities than an unsuccessful campaign.
