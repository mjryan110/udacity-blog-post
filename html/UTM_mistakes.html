    <h1>Five Common UTM Code Mistakes</h1>
    <p>
        So, you just discovered UTM parameters and want to use them immediately. Wait a minute though. First, check out our previous post on the Best Practices for UTM Codes and how to implement them. Second, if you’re ready for the next level, make sure you’re doing everything right. Avoid these five simple mistakes everyone makes (including industry leaders).
        <h2>Doubling Up Your UTM Codes</h2>
        UTM codes can be addicting. The more the merrier, right? Ignore that initial reaction to add a UTM code to every link you’ve got. There are some rules. Do not add UTM codes to internal links on your website. The entire purpose of UTM parameters is to identify where web traffic is coming from. If you add a parameter to an internal link, you’ll lose all of the external data your UTM codes were initially tracking, ruining your data.
        A customer reached a blog post from an email campaign you started last week. Your UTM codes have identified that web traffic as sourced from a newsletter. If you have new UTM codes on an internal link, such as your home page, that the same customer clicks on, they will then be identified as being sourced from a blog post. All your useful data, gone. Poof.
